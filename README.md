# Shopping Cart

GuitarLA Shopping Cart Web Application using HTML, React, and JavaScript

## Web Overview

The web allows users to explore a guitar catalog, view details, and manage a shopping cart. It uses Local Storage to persist the cart's state, ensuring data persists even if the user reloads the page or closes the browser.

- **Interactive Cart**: Users can:
  - Add guitars to the cart.
  - Increase or decrease the quantity of a product.
  - Remove specific products from the cart.
  - Clear the cart entirely.
